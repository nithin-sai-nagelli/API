I have written 4 files in 4 different directories in the java/com/example/demo directory.
Here u can see Java files named Book,BookService,BookRepository,BookController

Book.java helps to form the table java in the database.
BookController.java has varoious api end points and how they work.

Used in memory database of springboot which is H2.

And used postman to check whether the endpoints are working or not.
